# Content Automation Recommendations

This document provides recommendations for tools, automation, and workflow improvements to make the mitigator.ai content update process more efficient and effective. These recommendations focus on practical solutions that align with our nonprofit mission and technical environment.

## Content Management Workflow Tools

### 1. Project Management Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Key Features | Implementation Complexity |
|------|---------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Trello** | Content pipeline tracking | Visual boards, checklists, due dates, labels | Low |
| **Asana** | Content workflow management | Task dependencies, timeline views, approvals | Medium |
| **GitHub Projects** | Integrated content issue tracking | Direct integration with repository, automation | Low (already using GitHub) |
| **ClickUp** | Comprehensive content calendar | Content scheduling, status tracking, templates | Medium |

**Recommendation:** Implement **GitHub Projects** for content tracking to keep everything integrated with our existing GitHub repository. Create a dedicated Content Updates project board with automated workflows to track content from planning to publication.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create a "Content Updates" project in GitHub Projects
2. Configure columns: To Do, In Progress, Review, Ready to Publish, Published
3. Set up automation rules:
   - When issue with "content-update" label is created → add to "To Do"
   - When branch with "content/*" is created → move to "In Progress"
   - When PR is created → move to "Review"
   - When PR is merged → move to "Published"

### 2. Editorial Calendar Solutions

| Tool | Purpose | Key Features | Integration Options |
|------|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Google Calendar** | Simple visual scheduling | Shared team calendar, color coding, reminders | Google Workspace |
| **Airtable** | Content database and calendar | Custom fields, views, and automations | Zapier, Integromat |
| **CoSchedule** | Dedicated content calendar | Content planning, social integration | WordPress |
| **Editorial Calendar Spreadsheet** | Basic tracking and scheduling | Custom-built for exact needs, no extra cost | Manual updates |

**Recommendation:** Create an **Airtable** content calendar that tracks all content pieces, update schedules, owners, and status. Airtable provides flexibility for custom fields and views while enabling automation through Zapier.

**Implementation Example:**
- **Content Database Table** with fields for:
  - Content title, type, URL
  - Last updated date
  - Next review date (automated 3/6 month reminder)
  - Content owner
  - Status
  - Priority
  - SEO metrics
- **Calendar View** showing upcoming updates
- **Kanban View** showing content status
- **Automated email reminders** for scheduled updates

### 3. Accessibility Testing Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Features |
|------|---------|----------|
| **WAVE** | Web accessibility evaluation | Identifies accessibility errors and warnings |
| **axe DevTools** | Automated accessibility testing | Browser extension for quick checks |

| **Screen Reader Testing** | Manual accessibility testing | NVDA (Windows), VoiceOver (Mac) |

**Recommendation:** Incorporate **WAVE** and **axe DevTools** into the content testing process to ensure all content updates maintain accessibility standards.

## Automation Opportunities

### 1. GitHub Actions for Content Workflows

Create GitHub Actions workflows to automate repetitive tasks:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Action for content linting
name: Content Linting

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '**/*.md'
      - '**/*.html'

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Markdown Lint
        uses: DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2-action@v9
        with:
          globs: "**/*.md"
          
      - name: Link Checker
        uses: lycheeverse/lychee-action@v1.5.4
        with:
          args: --verbose --no-progress '**/*.md' '**/*.html'
          
      - name: Check for Placeholder Text
        run: |
          grep -r "\[.*\]" --include="*.md" --include="*.html" . || true
```

### 2. Content Update Reminders

Configure automated reminders for content that needs regular updates:

1. Use GitHub Actions to scan content for "Last Updated" dates
2. Generate issues for content that hasn't been updated in the specified period
3. Assign to appropriate content owners

```yaml
# Example GitHub Action for content freshness checking
name: Content Freshness Check

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 1 * *'  # Run monthly

jobs:
  check-freshness:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Check content dates
        run: |
          # Script to check "Last Updated" dates in content files
          # Create issues for content needing updates
```

### 3. Automated Publishing Workflow

Create a streamlined process for content updates using GitHub and automated deployment:

1. Content editor creates branch and updates content
2. PR is created with standardized template
3. GitHub Actions run automated checks (links, spelling, accessibility)
4. Reviewers are automatically assigned
5. Upon approval and merge, content is deployed
6. Slack/email notification is sent to team

## Process Improvement Recommendations

### 1. Content Update Triage System

Implement a triage system for content updates to prioritize work effectively:

| Update Type | Response Time | Process | Responsibility |
|-------------|---------------|---------|----------------|
| Critical (errors, broken functionality) | Same day | Expedited review and deployment | Technical Lead |
| Factual Updates (statistics, regulations) | Within 3 days | Standard review with SME focus | Content Owner + SME |
| Enhancement (adding content, improving SEO) | Within 1 week | Full review workflow | Content Team |
| Regular Maintenance (minor updates) | Monthly batches | Batch processing with standardized review | Content Coordinator |

### 2. Content Review Efficiency

Optimize the review process to reduce bottlenecks:

1. **Tiered Review System**:
   - Tier 1: Minor updates (typos, formatting) → Quick review by editor
   - Tier 2: Factual updates → Review by subject matter expert
   - Tier 3: Major content changes → Full team review

2. **Review Templates**:
   Create standardized review templates that reviewers can quickly complete:
   ```
   ## Content Review Form
   
   Content: [Title]
   Reviewer: [Name]
   
   ### Technical Accuracy
   - [ ] Accurate
   - [ ] Needs correction: [details]
   
   ### Mission Alignment
   - [ ] Aligns with mission
   - [ ] Needs adjustment: [details]
   
   ### Writing Quality
   - [ ] Meets standards
   - [ ] Needs improvement: [details]
   
   ### Approval Decision
   - [ ] Approved
   - [ ] Approved with suggested changes
   - [ ] Needs revision and re-review
   ```

### 3. Content Update Batching

Rather than processing updates ad-hoc, establish a batched update schedule:

1. **Monthly Maintenance Updates**:
   - Designate the first week of each month for routine content updates
   - Batch minor updates across multiple pages
   - Single testing and deployment process

2. **Quarterly Deep Reviews**:
   - Comprehensive review of key content sections
   - Update statistics, examples, and references
   - Refresh images and visual elements

3. **Annual Content Audit**:
   - Complete site-wide content evaluation
   - Identify outdated content for archival or major revision
   - Update all templates and standard language
