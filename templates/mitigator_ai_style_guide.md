# Mitigator.ai Style Guide

This document establishes the official style guidelines for all Mitigator.ai content to ensure consistency, clarity, and alignment with our nonprofit mission focused on AI governance and education.

## Voice and Tone

### Overall Voice
- **Authoritative but accessible**: Demonstrate expertise while remaining approachable
- **Educational**: Focus on informing and teaching rather than selling or promoting

- **Mission-driven**: Consistently reflect our nonprofit values and commitment to responsible AI

### Tone by Content Type

| Governance Frameworks | Formal, precise | "Organizations must implement rigorous testing protocols to ensure..." |
| Community Resources | Warm, encouraging | "Join our growing community of AI ethics advocates..." |
| Donation Appeals | Earnest, inspiring | "Your support enables critical research into AI safety..." |

## Language Guidelines

### General Principles
- Use plain language whenever possible
- Explain technical terms when they first appear
- Aim for 8th-10th grade reading level for general content
- Use active voice predominantly
- Keep sentences concise (average 15-20 words)
- Vary sentence structure to maintain reader interest

### Terminology Consistency

| Preferred Term | Instead Of | Notes |
|----------------|------------|-------|
| AI governance | AI management/control | Emphasizes structured guidance rather than restrictive control |
| Responsible AI | Ethical AI | More encompassing term that includes ethics, safety, and fairness |
| AI systems | AI models/programs | More inclusive of the entire technological stack |
| Community members | Users/clients | Reflects our nonprofit relationship with our audience |
| Educational resources | Products/offerings | Emphasizes our nonprofit educational mission |
| Impact | Results/outcomes | Focuses on meaningful change rather than metrics |

### Acronyms and Technical Terms
- Spell out acronyms on first use: "Natural Language Processing (NLP)"
- Include brief definitions of technical terms in parentheses or as footnotes
- Create a glossary for content with many technical terms
- Maintain a consistent approach to capitalization of technical terms

## Formatting Guidelines

### Text Formatting
- **Headings**: Title case for H1 and H2, sentence case for H3 and below
- **Paragraphs**: Keep to 3-5 sentences maximum when possible
- **Lists**: Use bulleted lists for unordered items, numbered lists for sequential steps
- **Bold**: Use for emphasis of key terms or important warnings
- **Italics**: Use for introducing technical terms or for minor emphasis
- **Links**: Embed in descriptive text rather than using "click here"

### Visual Elements
- Include at least one image for every 500 words of content
- Use diagrams to explain complex concepts
- Ensure all images have proper alt text for accessibility
- Use Mitigator.ai's color palette in all visual elements
- Prefer simple, clean infographics over complex data visualizations

## Grammar and Mechanics

### Punctuation
- Use serial (Oxford) commas: "governance, education, and community"
- Use em dashes (—) with no spaces for breaks in thought
- Use semicolons sparingly and only when connecting closely related independent clauses
- Avoid exclamation points except in very informal community content

### Numbers
- Spell out numbers one through nine; use numerals for 10 and above
- Use numerals for all percentages, measurements, and data points
- Use commas in numbers with four or more digits: 1,000
- Spell out "percent" in general text; use % symbol in technical writing and data

### Capitalization
- Capitalize proper nouns including names of specific frameworks, organizations, and programs
- Do not capitalize "artificial intelligence," "machine learning," etc. unless at start of sentence
- Capitalize "Mitigator.ai" consistently (not "mitigator.ai" or "Mitigator.AI")

## Citations and References

### In-Text Citations
- Use hyperlinked text for web resources
- For academic citations, use APA style with author name and year in parentheses
- Include page numbers for direct quotes from printed materials

### Reference Lists
- Include a "Further Reading" or "References" section at the end of longer content
- Format consistently using APA style
- Prioritize recent sources (within last 3 years) except for foundational work
- Include DOI links for academic papers when available

## SEO Guidelines

### Title Optimization
- Include primary keyword in the title, preferably near the beginning
- Keep titles under 60 characters when possible
- Make titles informative and compelling, not just keyword-focused

### Meta Descriptions
- Write unique meta descriptions for all pages
- Include primary keyword naturally within the text
- Keep to 150-160 characters
- Frame as a clear benefit or value proposition for the reader

### Content Structure
- Include primary keyword in first paragraph and at least one H2 heading
- Use H2 and H3 headings to create a logical content hierarchy
- Keep paragraphs short for readability
- Include descriptive alt text for all images, using keywords where natural

## Inclusive Language Guidelines

### Gender-Neutral Language
- Use "they/them" as singular pronouns instead of "he/she"
- Use gender-neutral terms: "chairperson" instead of "chairman"
- Avoid expressions that reinforce gender stereotypes

### Culturally Inclusive Language
- Avoid idioms that may not translate across cultures
- Be specific about regions/countries rather than using generalizations
- Consider global context when providing examples
- Avoid assuming Western norms or practices as universal

### Disability-Inclusive Language
- Use person-first language: "person with a disability" not "disabled person"
- Avoid ableist terms and metaphors (e.g., "blind to the issues")
- Focus on accessibility as a universal benefit, not a special accommodation

## Examples of Effective Content

### Strong Educational Intro Paragraph:
"Responsible AI governance frameworks provide organizations with structured approaches to ensuring artificial intelligence systems are developed and deployed ethically. These frameworks address critical concerns including bias mitigation, transparency, and accountability—issues that affect not just technical implementation but broader societal impacts. Understanding these frameworks is essential for any organization working to harness AI's benefits while minimizing potential harms."

### Weak Alternative to Avoid:
"AI governance frameworks are really important nowadays as AI gets more powerful. Companies need to make sure they're using AI right. There are lots of frameworks out there that help with this. This article will tell you about them."
